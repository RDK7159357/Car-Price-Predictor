Car Price Predictor is a web-based application designed to estimate the value of a vehicle based on user-provided details such as manufacturer, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven. The app leverages machine learning (or statistical modeling) to provide instant predictions, making it a useful tool for car buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface : A clean and responsive design built with Bootstrap, supporting both light and dark modes for an enhanced user experience.
Dynamic Form Handling : Real-time loading of car models based on the selected manufacturer.
Instant Predictions : Backend integration to process user inputs and return estimated car prices via an API or machine learning model.
Theme Toggle : Smooth transition between light and dark themes with intuitive sun/moon icons for theme switching.
Cross-Browser Compatibility : Fully responsive and optimized for modern browsers.
 Technologies Used
Frontend : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS), Bootstrap 5
Backend : Flask/Django/FastAPI (or any backend framework you're using)
Machine Learning : Python (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or other libraries for price prediction)
Deployment : Hosted on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS for seamless access.
 How It Works
Users input details about their vehicle (manufacturer, model, year, fuel type, kilometers driven).
The app sends the data to the backend, where a pre-trained machine learning model processes the inputs.
The predicted price is displayed instantly on the frontend.
 Project Structure
index.html: Main frontend file with the user interface.
app.py (or equivalent): Backend logic for handling requests and integrating the ML model.
static/: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets.
templates/: HTML templates (if using a templating engine like Jinja2).
model/: Pre-trained machine learning model and related scripts.
